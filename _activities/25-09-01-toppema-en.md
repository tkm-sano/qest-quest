### Method Validation of SF Prototyping – Toppema Case

This activity used the story of *Toppema* as material, but the main focus was on verifying the **methodology of SF prototyping**.  
Instead of providing a detailed narrative, we decomposed it into reproducible steps — worldbuilding, scenario work, and ELSI design — and organized a framework that can be transferred to future **social implementation, exhibitions, and dialogues**.

### Workflow
- Step 1: Survey existing research, institutions, and market trends to draft a hypothetical timeline  
- Step 2: Move between micro daily-life scenes and macro societal contexts to synthesize narratives  
- Step 3: Review from ELSI, inclusivity, and feasibility perspectives

### Submission
This activity was submitted to **SF NEXT – Expo Edition**, hosted by QunaSys.

### Story Summary
Born from a failed genetic modification experiment, the cat *Toppema* awakens as a special being connected to a quantum network and encounters Noriko in the city.  
As the device *DreamSphere* that manipulates dreams threatens Noriko’s memory and sleep, Toppema struggles to save her through quantum entanglement.  
Told from the perspective of a cat, this narrative questions how quantum technologies impact human intelligence, dreams, and views of life and death.

### Future Development
Going forward, we aim not only to explore the Toppema case, but also to further systematize **SF prototyping as a methodology**.
